            <p> I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. They did the job with no damage to my garage and
                cleaned it all up that same day. Great service.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide an estimate for its removal. They did the
                job fast and at the lowest bid. I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up. They took extra care not to disturb
                my lawn and garden. I highly recommend their service.</p>
